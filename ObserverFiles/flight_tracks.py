#  DRIP Observer - flight_tracks.py
#  Extracts per-drone position tracks (for mapping / summaries) from a capture,
#  reusing odid.py's parsers and decoders. This is a separate concern from
#  observer.py (which focuses on error/validation reporting): this module only
#  answers "where has each drone been".
#
#  GROUPING: a Location message has no identity of its own (ASTM Table 6 has no
#  DET field). Real captures do not always put Basic ID in the SAME pack as
#  every Location message (confirmed against real data: a drone re-announces
#  its Basic ID periodically, not on every transmission). We therefore track
#  identity as PERSISTENT STATE across the whole capture: once a Basic ID is
#  seen, every subsequent Location is attributed to it until a new Basic ID
#  appears - the same correlation strategy a real RID receiver uses. The
#  identity itself is the DRIP DET when the Basic ID uses SSI Type 1 (IETF
#  DRIP), or a generic hex label from the raw session ID otherwise - real
#  captures are not guaranteed to be DRIP-native (confirmed: a captured
#  third-party implementation uses SSI Type 246, not 1). A Location seen
#  before any Basic ID is bucketed under "unknown".
#
#  TIME: ASTM System (Table 11) carries NO timestamp field in this firmware
#  (see f3411_messages.h — F3411System has no timestamp member); any
#  "timestamp" decoded from it is the zero-filled reserved bytes, not real
#  time. We do NOT use it. Instead, each point's approximate time is the VNB
#  of the nearest DRIP auth message (Wrapper/Link/Manifest) found in the same
#  pack — a real, RFC 9575 §3.2.4.3 timestamp we already verify elsewhere in
#  this project. Point ORDER on the path is always transmission order in the
#  file, independent of any timestamp field.
