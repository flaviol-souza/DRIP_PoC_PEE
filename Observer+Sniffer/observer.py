#  Keyring — DET -> Ed25519 public key
#
#  The observer used to hold ONE key (--pubkey) and apply it to every DET it
#  met. That was correct while the transmitter was a single UA. It is not any
#  more: the bench emulator flies up to 3 virtual UAs, each with its OWN key and
#  DET (RFC 9374 3.5.2 binds a DET to the key it was derived from). With one
#  key, two of three drones would fail E-DET-02/E-SIG-01/E-MAN-01 against a key
#  that was never theirs -- a false accusation, not a finding.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The three bench identities, as PUBLIC data (det_generator.cpp IDENTITY_TABLE).
# Regenerate with det.py + ed25519.py:
#     seed0 = bytes.fromhex("568BF5E8...C703CCD6")          # slot 0 (legacy)
#     slot_seed = lambda i: det.shake128(b"DRIP PoC UA slot %d" % i, 32)
#     pub = ed25519.derive_pubkey(seed); d = det.compute_det(pub, 1000, 2000)
# NOTE: the observer no longer hard-codes any identities. Every DET->public_key
# comes from the trusted-identities file (hierarchy.json) via
# identity_resolve.iter_known_keys(). This is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH - there
# is no BUILTIN_KEYS table to drift out of sync with the JSON.
